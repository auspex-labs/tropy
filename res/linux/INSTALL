Installation Instructions
=========================
The Tropy Linux tarball is a binary release.
You can move this directory to any suitable location such as `/opt/tropy`,
and start the `tropy` binary there.

In the following instructions, change `/opt/tropy` to your preferred location.

1. Move this directory to `/opt/tropy`.
2. Add `/opt/tropy` to your `PATH` environment variable.
3. Copy the Tropy icons:

   cp -r /opt/tropy/resources/icons ~/.local/share/

4. Register Tropy's MIME types:

   cp -r /opt/tropy/resources/mime ~/.local/share/

5. Copy the file `.desktop` and `.metainfo.xml` file:

   cp /opt/tropy/org.tropy.Tropy.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
   cp /opt/tropy/org.tropy.Tropy.metainfo.xml ~/.local/share/metainfo/

6. And update MIME cache database:

   update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/


Updating
========
When updating to a newer version of Tropy,
replace your the entire installation directory with the new one.


Dark Theme
==========
When using the dark theme you may want to use your GTK theme's dark variant.
After changing the theme,
you will have to restart Tropy for the window frame to update accordingly;
if the menu or title bar don't use your GTK theme's dark variant,
try starting Tropy with `env GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark tropy` or your preferred theme.


Custom Themes
=============
You can adjust Tropy's user interface
by placing files called `style-light.css` and `style-dark.css`
into your user-data folder (or just `style.css` for adjusting all themes).


Sandbox
=======
Tropy requires your kernel to be configured with the options
`CONFIG_USER_NS` and `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1`.

As a fallback, you can `sudo chown root chrome-sandbox` and
`chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox` to use the SETUID sandbox instead,
or start Tropy with the `--no-sandbox` flag.


Wayland
=======
By default, Tropy will use the X11 or XWayland windows.
For native Wayland use the following command line switches:

    tropy --ozone-platform-hint=auto --enable-features=WaylandWindowDecorations

You can add those switches to your `tropy.desktop` launcher as well.


System Libraries
================
The Tropy tarball includes the Electron platform
and pre-compiled modules in `resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/node`
and in `resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/vendor`.
If you already have a system-wide installation of Electron,
you can use that instead, provided it has the same major version
as the one bundled here.

Similarly, you can use your distribution's libvips version
instead of the bundled image libraries.
To do this, remove the `resources/app.asar.unpacked/lib/vendor` folder.

Please note, that the major/minor version should match the one included here.

Moreover, the image formats supported by a custom-packaged Tropy may vary,
depending on which libraries are available in your distribution.
